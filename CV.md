I'm an audiovisual designer and among other things, a smartphone repair technician. I'm constantly searching for learning new things involving both design and technology, as well as getting over new challenges.

## **Personal Projects**
---
I've been learning 3D modeling with **Blender** since 2020 (sculpting, texturing, rigging and animating).  
I've been doing video editing since i was a child, as well as image editing.  
I have a Youtube channel called **GordoGamer** where i mix all my skills in audiovisual design to make videos about videogame analysis.
For automating and organizing each video project, i wrote a program in **Python** that creates the directories for me.   
Around 2016 i made a little game called **Phillip Against The Road** with **GameMaker** using its programming language **GML**.   
Last year i created an unfinished 2.5D platform game with **Unity** and programed it in **c#** and modeled it in 3D with **Blender**.  

## **Education**
---
* Currently studying Image and Sound Design at the **University of Buenos Aires** (2019 - current day). This carreer involves the three stages of a film production: pre-production (planning), production (filming) and post-production (editing).   
* I did a course on Smartphone Repair Technician at **CCTI** (02/07/16 - 06/29/16). I have learn the fundamentals of electricity, the tools needed for each task and how to continue learning in the field.  
* I did a course on Professional Photography at **IDES** (08/22/16 - 08/22/17). I have learn how to use a DSLR camera manually, how to control both natural and artificial light for a shot and how to edit photos with two different programs.  

## **Working Experience**
---
* Since 2016 i repair smartphones and other electronic devices. I can diagnose the problem and proceed to repair it if possible, wether it be replacing components or soldering new ones.
* Since 2017 i work now and then as a freelance photographer taking portraits and covering events.
* I have experience in customer service, since i've been working in that area for many years in the gastronomic field.
